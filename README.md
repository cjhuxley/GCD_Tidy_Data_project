GCD_Tidy_Data_project
=====================

Project files for John Hopkins Getting and cleaning Data Coursera Course 2014

This repository contains 3 files:
- Code_book.md
- README.md (this file),and
- run_analysis.R

> The purpose of the files are to prepare a tidy data set in the form of a space delimited text file.

>run_analysis.R will recreate the tidyData2.txt file submitted for the assignment. It is intened to be run in the UCI HAR Dataset folder from the unziped getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset. The original data can be accessed here:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

> A description of the original data and how it was gathered is located here:
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

> The principles of a tidy data set have been follwed in preparing the file. I based the criteria of a tidy data set on the paper by [Hadley Wickham Tiday](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

> Most of the detail on how the data was processed and meaning of the observations is in the code book (Code_book.md). The code book includes information on:
- basic characteristics of the resulting file
- nature of the data and decisions used in processing it
- how the data was processed, incuding references to the files used from the data set
- a table of location, definitions, range of values and units is provided for each variable and observation.
